  <h1>mel's js journey</h1>
  <p>back to <a href="..">webfun home</a></p>
  <p>i've been itching to make games n shit lately, and i figure,,, why not fuck around with javascript?? i've gotta fuck around with SOMETHING to get some initial experience. might as well be something web-friendly that i can work into my existing projects!!</p>
  <p>i have a <a href="../2025-swmf-form/">little experience</a> with js, but it's not enough to make anything to be REALLY proud of. i want to start from the basics to ensure i'm not setting myself into any nasty habits that i'll have to address later</p>
  <p>so i googled on duckduck, and lo, i found <a href="https://javascript.info/">a lovely tutorial at javascript.info</a> by <a href="https://github.com/iliakan">Ilya Kantor</a> and team. it's open source and liberally licensed, and i'm excited to share my progress through it here!</p>
  <p class="font-large">check <a href="javascript.info">my javascript.info working files</a>!!</p>
  <p>good luck to you on your own js travels, friend. lmk how it's going sometime!!</p>

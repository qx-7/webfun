    <h2>Elm? what's that?</h2>
    <p>i recently discovered <a href="https://elm-lang.org">Elm</a>,
        a strictly-typed functional language for frontend webdev.
        i'm having a ton of fun with it so far!
        i've been meaning to learn how to program in a functional
        paradigm, and i'm OBSESSED with frontend lately;
        elm is my obvious choice ;)</p>
    <p>the syntax is based on Haskell, which is new to me, but i'm getting the
        hang of it pretty quickly. i really like the strict typing system,
        and how the compiler uses it to rapidly identify programming errors!
        feels like i can't make a BAD elm program. it's great.</p>


    <h2>Pirate Weather</h2>
    <p class="font-large"><a href="./pirate-weather/index.html">latest version</a></p>
    <p>Elm is a delightfully FUNctional frontend webapp language,
        and i've been having a blast making my silly weather app with it!
        check it out! it's a little shitty right now, but most of the
        important functionality has already been implemented,
        so it's just the fun stuff from here!</p>
    <p>check out the
        <a href="https://github.com/qx-7/webfun/tree/main/2025-elm/pirate-weather">source code</a>!
        the elm files are all in the <code>src</code> directory.
        <strong>note:</strong> the javascript files have been compiled by elm!
        it's full of browser-specific words of encouragement and assorted
        treats (including jelly beans, gumdrops, etc). it's not supposed to be
        for people to read!!!</p>
